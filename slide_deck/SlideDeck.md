The idea
========================================================

Have you ever wondered how your mobile phone tries to guess the next best word when you are writing text on your smart phone?

The story behind the scene is that phone uses an algorithm that is predicting the next word using the most recent word or words you type on your phone.

The same logic has been used to create our Shiny App that tries to predict the next best word considering a word or a phrase provided by the app user!


The algorithm 1/2
